# LWW-Element-Set

Base on my understanding on some resources provided by Goodnotes.
Here is my CRDT LWW Element Set implementation.

---
*Please ignore the Code Quality Stuff on UI. I wrote them in simple MVC just to provide a user interface so we can try it on simulator or devices*

I separate the project into 2 xcodeproj:

**1. CRDTLWWElementSet**
The Implementation of CRDT LWW ELement Set complete with Unit Testing.

**2. CRDT-LWW-UI**
The UI with simple MVC just to present the code visually. I made it as fast as possible so, please ignore the design pattern :D
